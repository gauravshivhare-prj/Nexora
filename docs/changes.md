# Nexora — Change Control

## Purpose
This file prevents uncontrolled feature changes and scope creep.

## Rules

### 1. No Direct Feature Changes
Any requested change must be documented before implementation.

### 2. Change Record

Use:

```text
## CHANGE-001
Date:
Requested by:
Feature:
Reason:
Current behavior:
Requested behavior:
Impact:
Files/modules affected:
Risk:
Decision: Approved / Rejected / Deferred
Implemented:
Tested:
```

### 3. Change Categories

**Minor**
- Copy/text
- Spacing
- Non-functional UI adjustment

**Moderate**
- API modification
- Data model change
- Existing feature behavior change

**Major**
- New core feature
- Architecture change
- Database migration
- Authentication/security change

Major changes require review before coding.

## Freeze Rule
Once a phase is approved, do not modify its requirements casually.

## Scope Control
The following do NOT enter MVP without explicit approval:
- New major AI features
- Extra dashboards
- Complex integrations
- Microservices
- Unverified external data scraping
- Non-essential animations

## Rollback
Every major change must be reversible through Git.

## Documentation
Any approved change affecting:
- PRD
- SRS
- Architecture
- UI/UX
- API
must update the corresponding document.

## Nexora Design & Experience Standard

### Final Visual Theme — Sunset Warm
The finalized Nexora visual identity is **Sunset Warm**.

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Primary | `#EA580C` | Primary actions, key highlights, brand accents |
| Secondary | `#F97316` | Secondary actions, active states, emphasis |
| Background | `#FFF7ED` | Main application background |
| Success | `#22C55E` | Completed states, positive readiness signals |
| Warning | `#F59E0B` | Skill gaps, attention states |
| Error | `#EF4444` | Validation and error states |
| Text | `#6B7280` | Secondary text / metadata |
| Card | `#FFFFFF` | Cards, panels, forms |

### Experience Principle
Nexora must feel like a **real student career-support product**, not a generic AI wrapper or a collection of disconnected screens.

The interface should communicate:
- clarity,
- progress,
- trust,
- guidance,
- student continuity,
- actionable next steps.

### Motion & Animation Standard
Use purposeful, smooth animation wherever it improves comprehension or continuity.

Appropriate uses:
- Page/section transitions
- Dashboard card entrance
- Progress-ring animation
- Skill-bar progression
- Roadmap step transitions
- Career-match reveal
- AI analysis/progress states
- Modal/drawer transitions
- Success/completion feedback
- Skeleton loading states
- Hover/focus micro-interactions

Avoid:
- excessive bouncing,
- random decorative motion,
- long transitions,
- animations that delay interaction,
- animation on every element,
- distracting parallax.

Recommended behavior:
- Micro-interactions: ~150–250ms
- Standard transitions: ~250–400ms
- Complex/reveal animations: ~400–700ms
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

Animation must reinforce **cause → effect**. For example, completing an assessment should visibly update the relevant readiness/skill state instead of merely showing a generic success toast.
